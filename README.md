# Chess_modeling
Repo used to apply my data science skills onto one of my biggest hobby's, Chess! i hope to learn more models and data science stuff during this project :)

I will be using a dataset from kaggle. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess
This repo is for me to check out different models on the dataset. different ways to set parameters, etc. 
It might be a slight mess. THis is my first repo ever, never used github before. Also in the process of learning DS, not an expert :)
If somehow somebody does find this repo and decides to help code (dont even know if this is posible but still) please, make a seperate branch, make your model on there.
