# Chess_modeling
## warning! 
this repo is only for my learning. The code for the time being is not gonna be very good and i wouldnt recommend to reuse any code.
This is just more a playground for me to learn github, Learn deeplearning (at least understand it more) and check other skills ive learned over the past year

## what does it contain??
right now this repo contains:
- A analysis file (data_analyis) with analysis on the data, distributions, visualisations, etc.
- A deep_learning_1 file thats empty at the time of writing this, but will be filled up at some point in the future.
- A library file for functions that i can then import into other files (also just to check skills)
- a simple model file with a very simple decision tree model that predicts the winner of a match based on some match data (elo of each player being most contributing factor, Duh) with an accuracy of 62% and some plots and after-model fun stuff.
- A chess bot (done with help of chatgpt) to see if i can understand pytorch a bit better and also to visualise the board better and get better at bigger harder projects. it predicts the next move in a position based on the kaggle dataset.
- a explain.txt which can be ignored. didnt end up using it.

## what tools are used?
- pytorch (torch) and its respective functions and things
- pandas
- numpy
- Seaborn and matplotlib
- own written functions
- sklearn
- other libraries from python (random, chess, nbimporter, etc)
- Kaggle chess dataset (linked).

## what goals where met with this repo?
i learned a bit more on pytorch which was a big goal of mine over the summer (get a head start before i start deeplearning in school). i sharpened some already known skills (analysis, simple sklearn models). 
I learned github a bit better and learned how to use multiple files (used to do projects in one big file). as well as some other generally usefull IT skills learned. 

## Why no branches?
i know why branches are used and how they are used, but since i didnt have a "main" and am using jupyter notebook so i cant really mess up other code by adding more (if used correctly ofcourse) i made the decision to just not.
